DocsGarden aims to make a variety of notes, documentation, ebooks, and other digital text easily available for importing into your own knowledge management tools!

We prioritize converting content into [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/)-compatible vaults. This is what is meant whenever "Dendronized" content is mentioned. In the future, we may support others like Obsidian and Logseq.

Dendron is excellent for wrangling your own thoughts, projects, journaling, and personal knowledge. But what about magically leveling up by importing entire knowledge bases already maintained by companies, technical writers, authors, and online communities?

Dendron can be used in a multi-vault configuration that treats multiple vaults as dependencies. Self contained vaults helped make this easier. A multi-vault pattern is intended to make it as easy as possible to work with multiple vault types:

- Private notes
- Public notes
- Shared notes, with teams or others in public
- Shared notes, with teams or others in private

DocsGarden is working to expand what is available in the land of public notes. In addition to referencing the personal digital gardens that others have made for their blogs and websites, we want to be able to import a variety of public technical documentation instead of traversing their public docs portals.

This provides a lot of opportunity around re-usable content (not redefining what is already in the official docs, but instead linking or note referencing), remixing content (building tutorials around note references containing official doc snippets), and more.

## About Dendron

DocsGarden considers Dendron's vault format to be the preferred format when it comes to making knowledge easily consumable to all.

Are you interested in creating your own knowledge base using markdown, git, and [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/))? Take a look at the [Dendron Getting Started Guide](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/678c77d9-ef2c-4537-97b5-64556d6337f1/).

A majority of the Dendron community interaction currently happens on the [Dendron Discord](https://link.dendron.so/discord). ðŸŒ± The community talks about things related to Dendron, PKM, and making sense of the world around us!
